# Dynamic Greetings

This is a simple web page that displays a dynamic greeting message based on the current time of day. The greeting message changes according to the time, displaying "Good Morning Friend" in the morning, "Good Afternoon Friend" in the afternoon, and "Good Evening Friend" in the evening.

## Prerequisites

Before running this web page, make sure you have the following:

- Web browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox)

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the code files.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Files

The project consists of the following files:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that displays the greeting message.
- `style.css`: The CSS file that defines the styles for the web page.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that calculates the current time and sets the greeting message.

## Usage

When you open the `index.html` file in a web browser, you will see a container element with the class name "container" and the default text "DEMO TEXT". However, the JavaScript code dynamically updates the container's content based on the current time, replacing it with the appropriate greeting message.

## Customization

You can customize the appearance of the web page by modifying the styles defined in the `style.css` file. Feel free to change the background color, font size, container width, and other CSS properties to suit your preferences.

Additionally, you can modify the greeting messages by editing the JavaScript code in the `script.js` file. Update the conditions and messages in the `greeting` variable to display different greetings based on your desired time ranges.

This project uses the following dependencies:

- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/css2?family=Poppins&display=swap): The web font used for the greeting message.
